# In order for Dabo to 'see' classes in your cache directory, add an
# import statement here for each class. E.g., if you have a file named
# 'MyClasses.py' in this directory, and it defines two classes named 'FirstClass'
# and 'SecondClass', add these lines:
#
# from MyClasses import FirstClass
# from MyClasses import SecondClass
#
# Now you can refer to these classes as: self.Application.cache.FirstClass and
# self.Application.cache.SecondClass
